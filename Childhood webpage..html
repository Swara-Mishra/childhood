<H1>Ludwig van Beethoven's Childhood</H1>
<P>The Beethoven family business was music. When young Ludwig, whom we know as Ludwig van Beethoven, was born in December 1770, he would become the third generation of the family who would make his living as a musician. He was undoubtedly the most talented member of his family and his father hoped that it would bring fame and fortune to the family. Although Beethoven’s talents were recognized early, they were not always nurtured in the best ways and family life was often tumultuous. 
Beethoven was named after his grandfather, or Ludwig the elder, who was born in 1712 in a small town in what is now Belgium. His childhood was dominated by his father, a tough taskmaster and an alcoholic. He would come home drunk, drag the young Beethoven out of bed and make him play the piano. After his wife died, the father, says Swafford, would sometimes be found in the gutter, and his children had to persuade the police not to arrest him. As his father declined, Beethoven took over the role of wage earner and caretaker of the family. He also assumed his father’s controlling and domineering ways.</P>
